- Setup and configured dev environment: VSCode on Windows with remote Debian WSL, configured C++ Intellisense to use g++ and boost libraries
- Figured out how to include boost and compile with g++
- Installed CMake and Native Debug VSCode plugins
- ToDo - test CMake compilation, test boost filesystem code, read C++ structure webpages (see saved Firefox session 15/6)

- Made decision to use std::filesystem from C++17 preferably over boost::filesystem - standard lib vs 3rd party include
