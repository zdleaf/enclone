Feature list
- run as unix daemon
    - setup separate user with correct permissions
- config file
- output logs to named files, each thread has own log file - can watch live in console with "tail -f file.log"
- add proper exclusions, e.g. ".swp" temporary files
- unstructured db such as mongodb would be better at storing fileIndex as a tree like structure - easy to pull entire contents of a directory for example
- store data as "blobs" or small chunks - this mean when updating a file version, we just update the blobs that have changed instead of re-uploading entire file
    - see Rabin Fingerprints for implementing Content Defined Chunking (CDC)
