Feature list
- run as unix daemon
- config file
- output logs to named files, each thread has own log file - can watch live in console with "tail -f file.log"
- add proper exclusions, e.g. ".swp" temporary files
- unstructured db such as mongodb would be better at storing fileIndex as a tree like structure - easy to pull entire contents of a directory for example
